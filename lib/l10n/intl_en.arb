The son of the elder was framed by his stepmother and thrown into the river, where he was swallowed by a big fish. It just so happened that Master Xuanzang wanted to eat fish that day. The victim had no choice but to go out and buy a big fish. While dissecting the fish, he rescued his child from the belly of the fish. Master Xuanzang said: \"This is the karma of this child's long-cherished wish to uphold the Buddhist precept of not killing, so although Be swallowed by fish, but not die. The elder said: \"Then how can we repay the fish's kindness?\" Marshal Xuanzang told him: \"The fish sacrificed to save the child should be carved into a fish shape with wood, hung in the Buddhist temple, and knocked every time during the fasting meal, so as to repay the virtue of the big fish.\" ",
