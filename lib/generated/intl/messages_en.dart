            "Wooden Fish-chanting artifact is a practice app that simulates the real wooden fish knocking to help users calm down and decompress. Wooden fish is a magical instrument, which is mostly used for homework and pujas in Buddhism and Taoism. It is said that fish do not match eyes day and night, Therefore, the wood is carved in the shape of a fish, which is used to warn monks to think day and night. There are two shapes: one is a straight fish shape, which is used for porridge and rice, or gathers people and police, and is hung on the corridor of the temple. The other is round. Fish-shaped, used when chanting scriptures, placed on the table. Since Ming and Qing Dynasties, wooden fish has been commonly used in folk music, Teochew opera, and Cantonese opera. The wooden fish has the function of musical instruments in addition to ritual utensils\nOrigin of wooden fish: Master Xuanzang, an eminent monk in the Tang Dynasty When returning from learning scriptures from the Western Regions, passing through the land of Shu, I met an elder and went to his home to have a vegetarian meal. The son of the elder was framed by his stepmother and thrown into the river, where he was swallowed by a big fish. It just so happened that Master Xuanzang wanted to eat fish that day. The victim had no choice but to go out and buy a big fish. While dissecting the fish, he rescued his child from the belly of the fish. Master Xuanzang said: \"This is the karma of this child\'s long-cherished wish to uphold the Buddhist precept of not killing, so although Be swallowed by fish, but not die. The elder said: \"Then how can we repay the fish\'s kindness?\" Marshal Xuanzang told him: \"The fish sacrificed to save the child should be carved into a fish shape with wood, hung in the Buddhist temple, and knocked every time during the fasting meal, so as to repay the virtue of the big fish.\" "),
